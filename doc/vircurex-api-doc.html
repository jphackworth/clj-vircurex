  Trade API


The trade API provides functions that allow to perform trading activities.


      Notice

The trading API is released in its version 1.0. If we change the API
call's then we will be releasing a new version and keep the previous
version available for a specified period of time. Any changes will of
course be communicated in the Announcement and News section but if you
wish to subscribe to our API mailing lists then send us a short email
(customerservice@vircurex.com).


      Activating the API

The trading API needs to be activated before it can be used. The API
accesses your account information and allows to create and execute
orders, hence all connections are via HTTPS only. In addition, you need
to specify a security word for each of the API functions. The trading
API is activated in your user profile.

Notes on the parameters:

  * The sequence of the parameters is irrelevant. The sequence when
    putting together the token is crucial.
  * YourUserName: Provide your login name, not your eMail address. The
    value is case sensitive.
  * Securityword: The security word you have entered for the respective
    API call in your user settings. The value is case sensitive.
  * Ordertype: values are SELL or BUY
  * currency: Use the currency short forms, e.g. USD, BTC, NMC, etc.
  * Prices and quantities: Use . as a decimal seperator. Do not use
    thousands separator
  * Otype: Set otype=0 for unreleased orders, otype=1 for released orders


Apart from the parameters listed on the table above, the following four
parameters must always be supplied:
Parameter 	Description
account	Your login name, not the email address
id	Any value. The ID value cannot be reused within a period of 10
minutes. This is to safeguard against accidental double postings as well
as URL replays by malicious sources.
token	A SHA2 hash across a number of input values. See below detils on
how to calculate it
timestamp	A UTC timestamp, must be within 5 minutes of the current time


      Calculation of the Token

The token is calculated by concatenating the input parameters, separated
by a semi-colon and then calculating a SHA2-256 hash over the complete
string. See the column "Token calculation" in the above function API
list for the required fields that need to be included to calculate the
hash.
Here an examples (in Ruby) for creating an order:

 t = Time.now.gmtime.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
 trx_id = Digest::SHA2.hexdigest("#{t}-#{rand}")
 user_name = "MY_USER_NAME"
 secret_word = "123456789"
 tok =
Digest::SHA2.hexdigest("#{secret_word};#{user_name};#{t};#{trx_id};create_order;sell;10;btc;50;nmc")
 Order.call_https("https://vircurex.com","/api/create_order.json?account=#{user_name}&id=#{trx_id}&token=#{tok}&timestamp=#{t}&ordertype=sell&amount=10&currency1=btc&unitprice=50&currency2=nmc")


 def self.call_https(my_url,my_params)
  uri = URI.parse(my_url)
  http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, '443')
  http.use_ssl = true
  http.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER
  response=""
  resp=""
  http.start do |http|
   cmd = my_params
   req = Net::HTTP::Get.new(cmd)
   response = http.request(req)
   resp = response.body
  end
  return ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(resp)
 end
